# strategy-game

## mission

- A building which creates some units, they move around toward an area and are deleted, explode or die  
- Have a worker collect a resource and increment a simple UI element to indicate the amount collected 
- Make a UI to manage a few different resources, then use those resources to place/construct a building in the environment, and update the resources 
- Construct multiple buildings of the same type but don’t let them build on top of each other, bonus points if you decrement resources for doing so 
- Implement a spell or “ability” attack on a group of baddies, visibly affect them, and expose the ability to modify a parameter of the attack – maybe radius or intensity?  
- Any combination of the above. We just made this stuff up.  

## contraints

- Please use Unity 
- This should work on mobile (you’ll be producing an APK)   
- Store assets/plugins are fine, but you should do some programming to bring this together – we specifically want to know how you code and think.  
- Try to spend no more than 4 hours on this after you’ve set up your dev environment and really start working – we don’t want to tank your whole day! Sloppy is OK because we’ll be asking you how to improve your solution afterwards.  
- We don’t care how it looks art-wise. Don’t spend more time on this than you have to.
